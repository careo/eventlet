Port of Eventlet library for Ruby/EventMachine + fibers
    (c) 2009 Dane Jensen (careo)

Well. Not literally a port. More like heavily inspired by both Eventlet and Stackless Python.

It uses Fibers as the 'greenlets' or 'tasklets', and the EventMachine to handle the scheduling.

Dependencies:
 * EventMachine
 * Bacon
